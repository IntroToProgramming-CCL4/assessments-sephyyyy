# Exercise 1: Coding is Cool

# This program prints the phrase 'Coding is Cool' using string concatenation.

# I used the phrase's words to define three string variables.
word1 = "Coding"
word2 = "is"
word3 = "Cool"

# This line then concatenates the variables using the + operator and adds spaces between each word.
print(word1+' '+word2+' '+word3)
