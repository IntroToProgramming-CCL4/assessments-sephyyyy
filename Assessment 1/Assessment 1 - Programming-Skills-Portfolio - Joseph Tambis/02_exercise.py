# Exercise 2: Simple Sums

# This program defines two integers, calculates the sum, places the result in a third variable, and then prints the final value.

# I defined the value of two integer variables to 8 and 10.
a = 8
b = 10

# This the determines the sum of a and b, then records the outcome in variable c.
c = a+b

# This then finishes the task by printing the variable 'c' which holds the sum of 'a' and 'b'.
print(c)
